# Introduction to browser events

## Summary

There are 3 ways to assign event handlers:

1. HTML attribute: `onclick="..."`.
2. DOM property: `elem.onclick = function`.
3. Methods: `elem.addEventListener(event, handler[, phase])` to add, `removeEventListener` to remove.

HTML attributes are used sparingly, because JavaScript in the middle of an HTML tag looks a little bit odd and alien. Also can’t write lots of code in there.

DOM properties are ok to use, but we can’t assign more than one handler of the particular event. In many cases that limitation is not pressing.

The last way is the most flexible, but it is also the longest to write. There are few events that only work with it, for instance `transitionend` and `DOMContentLoaded` (to be covered). Also addEventListener supports objects as event handlers. In that case the method `handleEvent` is called in case of the event.

No matter how you assign the handler – it gets an event object as the first argument. That object contains the details about what’s happened.

We’ll learn more about events in general and about different types of events in the next chapters.
